This is an HID example that demonstrates Human Interface Device (HID)
on USB Device.

Detailed description is available on:
www.keil.com/pack/doc/MW/USB/html/dev_hid_tutorial.html

Board:                  ST 'STM32F072B-DISCO'
Microcontroller:        ST 'STM32F072RBT6'
Clock Settings:         HSI48 RC = 48 MHz
                        CPUCLK   = 48 MHz
                        USB CLK  = 48 MHz
USB Full-speed:         USB USER (connector CN2)
User Interface:         input:  User button USER
                        output: User LEDs (LED1..4)

The example demonstrates a Human Interface Device. The board LEDs and
push button can be accessed from the PC through a custom
HID Client Program (.\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe).

The program is available for target(s):
- Debug:
  - Compiler optimization Level 1
  - Debug USB library
  - Enabled Event Recorder
- Release:
  - Compiler optimization Level 3
  - Release USB library
